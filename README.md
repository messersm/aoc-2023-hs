# aoc-2023-hs
> Advent of Code with Haskell

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Haskell.

The program takes the puzzle number as first parameter
and outputs solutions to part 1 and 2,
so something like the following should get you going:

```shell
cd aoc-2023-hs
stack run 1
```
